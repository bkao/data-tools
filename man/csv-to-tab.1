.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
csv\-to\-tab OPTIONS [CSV_FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Read a CSV file from file specified on command line or standard input
and write the corresponding tab delimited file to standard output.
.PP
In the tab delimited format fields are delimited by tabs and records are
terminated by an end\-of\-line marker.
\f[C]csv\-to\-tab\f[] uses newline as the end\-of\-line marker.
.PP
There is no mechanism for quoting tabs or newlines, and by default
\f[C]csv\-to\-tab\f[] will fail if they occur in the fields of the CSV
file.
