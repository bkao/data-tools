.TH CSV-TO-TSV 1 "February 16, 2013" 
.SH NAME
.PP
csv-to-tsv - convert CSV to TSV
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
csv-to-tsv OPTIONS [CSV_FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Read a CSV file from file specified on command line or standard input
and write the corresponding TSV file to standard output.
.PP
In the TSV format fields are delimited by tabs and records are
terminated by an end-of-line marker.
\f[C]csv-to-tsv\f[] uses newline as the end-of-line marker.
.PP
There is no mechanism for quoting tabs or newlines, and by default
\f[C]csv-to-tsv\f[] will fail if they occur in the fields of the CSV
file.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-e, --escape : Use backslash escape sequences to escape tabs, carriage
returns, newlines, and backslashes.
.PP
--header=NAME[,NAME...] : comma-separated list of column names.
Use if CSV does not have a header row.
.PP
-r, --replace : replaces tabs and characters that should be interpreted
as newlines as newlines with spaces.
The characters treated as newlines are: \\f \\n \\r \\v \\x85 \\u2028
\\u2029.
.PP
-x, --strip : Remove tabs, carriage returns, and newlines in fields.
