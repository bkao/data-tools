.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
json-ruby [-j|-t] [-i] (-f RUBY_PATH | RUBY_SCRIPT) [JSON_INPUT] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Read input containing one JSON object per line and parse it.
Each parsed object is placed in the global accumulator variable $_ where
it can be accessed by the Ruby script.
.PP
The Ruby script can be provided on the command line or read from the
file RUBY_PATH.
.PP
BEGIN and END blocks can be defined in the manner of \f[C]awk\f[] to
define Ruby code which executes at the start or end of execution.
.PP
By default the script exits with an error if a line contains invalid
JSON.
Use the \f[C]-i\f[] flag to keep going.
.SH OPTIONS

-f PATH, --file=PATH : execute the Ruby script in the file at PATH.
